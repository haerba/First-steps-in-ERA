# First-steps-in-ERA
This repository collects experience on how to get started in ERA.

In this repository, we will share our experience in working with ROS. There is only one tutorial about starting on ERA, since it is a tool recently developed and the information given only explains how to install the tool and how to start it, not how you can really take advantage from ERA to your own projects. After working on ERA for the last 6 months, we have understood how ERA works and here you will find the modifications done to improve the tool.

ERA is fully run on Linux-based operating systems. If you are not familiar with Linux, this [official guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/getting-started.html.en) might help you to get familiarized with it.

In this repository, I have uploaded the scripts, modifications & files . Therefore, some topics of ROS haven't been covered. To learn more about ROS, the documentation below can be useful.
